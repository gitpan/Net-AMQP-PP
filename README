NAME
    Net::AMQP::PP - Nasty hack for when you want pure perl
    AnyEvent::RabbitMQ

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::AMQP::PP;
        use AnyEvent::RabbitMQ; # Note - order is important!

DESCRIPTION
    This module horribly monkeypatches NET::AMQP to avoid it's need to load
    XML::LibXML.

    This code does disgusting things, and should be considered alpha
    quality.

    It uses the flavour of the AMQP spec inlined into AnyEvent::RabbitMQ to
    be compatible with that module.

    Note that this module depends on Net::AMQP, which cannot be installed
    without XML::LibXML, and therefore is only useful when you're trying to
    make something with App::FatPacker.
